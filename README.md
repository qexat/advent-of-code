# Advent of Code

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2024.

Puzzle inputs are fetched from the root folder `inputs` where the contents are stored in a file which name is simply the day number from 1 to 25.

## Usage

```sh
dune exec aoc -- -day <number> [-attempt]
```

The flag `-attempt` will use the puzzle input instead of the example.
